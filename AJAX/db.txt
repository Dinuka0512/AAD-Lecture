A paragraph is a self-contained unit of writing that focuses on a single idea or theme. It typically begins with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by supporting sentences that elaborate on that idea, providing details, examples, or explanations. A well-structured paragraph is unified, meaning all sentences relate to the central idea, and it is coherent, ensuring a logical flow of thoughts. Paragraphs can vary in length but should generally contain at least one complete sentence and be part of a larger text, such as an essay or article.
